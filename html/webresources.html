that is walkable for even beginners or people that need a refresher in the syntax of the code. <br />

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">CSS</a><br />
<div id="summary">Summary: W3Schools for CSS is just as good as the HTML resource.</div> <br /> 
<div id="body">W3Schools for CSS is the ideal resource for beginners to start out learning about web development. There is a<br />
reason I have this as a resource for 3 different portions of the website. This is perfect and has taught me and countless<br />
others how to begin coding in various languages. It is quick to refer back to if you forget something and fast to navigate<br />
through to find what you need.</div><br />

<p id="c">
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/index.php">Bootstrap 5</a><br />
<div id="summary">Summary: Bootstrap 5 throught W3Schools is handy and should be used when starting out with web development.</div><br />
<div id="body">Bootstrap is a little more involved than just using CSS. This is more for people that already know CSS <br />
and want to expand their knowledge with more developed way to stylize your website. These three resources on W3Schools can be<br />
a launching point for newwer web developers. It is a great resource for those that know more and just need a refresher on the <br />
subjects. Or if you need to look back at certain parts to make sure the syntax is correct.</div><br />

  <p id="d">
  <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/">Color Picker</a><br />
  <div id="summary">Summary: This website is easy to use and very direct to what you need.</div><br />
  <div id="body">Color codes are numerous and impossible to memorize all colors that can be used on a website. This website<br />
    will let you pick the exact shade you need for your website or find new ones that you didn't think you wanted. It is <br />
    easy to use and you can just copy and paste the code to you CSS. Since this is a website dedicated to finding the right<br />
    color for you and being able to search through the spectrum of the color wheel, it can be overwhelming. However, this <br />
    website breaks it up into a smaller spectrum that is more easily searched through.</div><br />

    <p id="e">
    <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn">Free Code Camp</a><br />
    <div id="summary">Summary: Free Code Camp is a good resource for people who are limited on funds but want to learn about web development.</div><br />
    <div id="body">Free Code Camp is more structured in the teaching of software development than W3Schools. There are <br />
      certifications that you can receive through this website which could help you in landing a job in the career you are <br />
      looking for. You do have to sign up for the website with your email. Some may not want to do that and prefer using <br />
      W3Schools for the learning. However, Free Code Camp will go deeper in the understanding of software and web development.<br />
      Once you have learned all you can on W3Schools you can go to this website and breeze right through the majority of it as well<br />
      as getting a handle on the more advanced aspects that W3Schools is lacking.</div><br />
